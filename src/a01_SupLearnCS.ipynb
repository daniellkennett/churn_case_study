    "A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention.\n",
    "To help explore this question, we have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of\n",
    "users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July\n",
    "1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip)\n",
    "in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). In other words, a\n",
    "user is \"active\" if they have taken a trip since June 1, 2014. The data,\n",
    "`churn.csv`, is in the [data](data) folder.  The data are split into train and\n",
    "test sets.  You are encouraged to tune and estimate your model's performance on\n",
    "the train set, then see how it does on the unseen data in the test set at the\n",

    "We would like you to use this data set to help understand **what factors are\n",
    "the best predictors for retention**, and offer suggestions to help Company X. \n",

    "model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows you to interpret the\n",

    "- `avg_rating_by_driver`: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips \n",
    "- `avg_rating_of_driver`: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips \n",
    "- `surge_pct`: the percent of trips taken with surge multiplier > 1 \n",
    "- `avg_surge`: The average surge multiplier over all of this user’s trips \n",
    "- `trips_in_first_30_days`: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up \n",
