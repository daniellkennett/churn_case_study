# Data Cleansing

## Missing Values:
The dataset was missing data from 3 columns ('avg_rating_by_driver','avg_rating_of_driver', and 'phone'). Rather than drop these columns, we imputed the values in 2 ways. The first method was using SimpleImputer that calculates the mean value for the column and replaces the missing values with the mean. This was used for the rating columns. The second method used was the KNNImputer which used the 5 nearest neighbor (k=5) to determine the value. This was used for the phone column. 

## Removing Data Leakage from the dataset
We realized after running a logistic regression that the last_trip_date column was causing data leakage since it was a transformation of our dependent variable/target value. We also dropped the signup date column since all the signups happened in the same month and therefore thought this column had no signficant value.

## How did you compute the target?
We computed the target by engineering a new binary feature "active" that takes the value of 1 if the rider did have a ride within the last 30 days, and 0 otherwise. 

## What model did you use in the end? Why? 
Ultimately, gradient boost with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning achieved the best scores 
    
## Alternative models you considered? Why are they not good enough?
We considered random forest and logistic models, however they were not good enough because
