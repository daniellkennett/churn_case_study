# Data Cleansing

## Missing Values:
The dataset was missing data from 3 columns ('avg_rating_by_driver','avg_rating_of_driver', and 'phone'). Rather than drop these columns, we imputed the values in 2 ways. The first method was using SimpleImputer that calculates the mean value for the column and replaces the missing values with the mean. This was used for the rating columns. The second method used was the KNNImputer which used the 5 nearest neighbor (k=5) to determine the value. This was used for the phone column. 

## Removing Data Leakage from the dataset
We realized after running a logistic regression that the last_trip_date column was causing data leakage since it was a transformation of our dependent variable/target value. We also dropped the signup date column since all the signups happened in the same month and therefore thought this column had no signficant value.

# How did you compute the target?
We computed the target by engineering a new binary feature "active" that takes the value of 1 if the rider had a ride within the last 30 days, and 0 otherwise. 

### TLDR;
1: active user
2. churned user

# What model did you use in the end? Why? 
Gradient boosting, radom forest and logistical regression were all tested.
Ultimately, gradient boost with hyperparameter tuning achieved the best scores. 


# What performance metric did you use to evaluate the model? Why?
We decided on mean accuracy against Test data (typically the .score method of the models in sci kit learn). 

# Based on insights from the model, what plans do you propose to reduce churn?

1. The company should reevaluate their advertisement budget in Kingâ€™s Landing, Astapor, Winterfell. For example, if the company equally distributes the budget among all three, they are getting more activity from city one, so it may be more in the interest of the company to focus their spending more. 

2. When customers are getting hit by surge pricing, they trend towards churning. Reduce surge price rates. 

# What are the potential impacts of implementing these plans or decisions? What performance metrics did you use to evaluate these decisions, why?
